          <blockquote>From diving the Red Sea’s crystal blue waters and stargazing amid the vastness of the <br> desert to floating down the Nile River and standing in awestruck wonder before the <br> ruins of one of the world’s most ancient civilizations... When it comes to travel <br> experiences, Egypt is a destination that leaves visitors spoiled for choice.

           <br> <br> With so much to see, the struggle for many visitors is just where to begin – as always,<br> we’re happy to help! Here is our pick of the 8 best places to visit in Egypt.</blockquote>
        
          <h1>1.Cairo</h1>
           <blockquote>Egypt’s bustling capital city is layered with cultural, religious, architectural and even <br> culinary history. Its wonders stretch far beyond the walls of its famous museums. You <br>can take in centuries worth of sights just by walking down the city streets, and <br> discover untapped wonders just by saying hello <br> Then there are the Pyramids of Giza, truly a wonder of the world.

            <br> <br>  At the epicenter of history in the core of the city is Islamic Cairo, the city's most <br> atmospheric quarter. Just grab your camera and venture down its vibrant  <br>alleyways Take in the views from the Citadel and the old city gates – known as Bab  <br>Zuweila, Bab al-Futuh and Bab an Nas r – and admire the intricate details of the area’s  <br>stunning mosques. The ancient Mosque of Muhammad Ali, Ibn Tulun Mosque and <br>Al-Hakim Mosque are particularly incredible. Islamic Cairo is also home to <br> monument-lined  Muizz Street and Khan El-Khalili bazaar – great spots to grab some.
            
            <br> <br> A more under-the-radar-spot is Coptic Cairo, home to the Coptic Museum, the <br> Hanging Church, the towers of the vanished Babylon fortress – the focal point of <br> Egypt’s tiny Christian minority since the first century CE.
            
            <br> <br> Local tip: By night, Cairo transforms thanks to its buzzing nightlife scene – sip a drink  <br>in historic downtown bars or take in live performances at hip clubs and art spaces.

          <h1>2. Marsa Alam</h1>
          <blockquote>Life is definitely better when you’re scuba diving through colorful corals  and <br> swimming with dolphins, dugongs and sea turtles in Marsa Alam’s beautiful blue <br> waters. A serene escape on the western shore of the Red Sea, Marsa Alam is one of <br> the top spots in Egypt for underwater escapes. Popular dive spots include the <br>Elphinstone reef and Abu Dabbab, one of the world's top beaches for snorkeling.
  
           <br> <br>  For land-based adventures, head to Wadi el Gemal National Park, where you can lay <br> back by the water at Hankorab Beach or safari, hike or bike through rugged,<br> mountainous terrain. Keep an eye out for camels at Sharm El Luli Beach or take in the <br> beautiful scenery at the resort town of Qulaan.
            
             <br> <br>To learn about Marsa Alam’s local Bedouin community, visit the Ababda House <br> Cultural Museum or have dinner and an aromatic cup of Jebena coffee with the locals.
            
            <br> <br> Detour: If you're looking for interesting souvenirs, head to Ghosoun and Hamata and  <br>meet local tribeswomen making unique hand-woven crafts and jewelry (each tribe has <br> its own unique patterns and styles). 
            
            </blockquote>

            <h1>3. Luxor</h1>
            <blockquote>The site of the magnificent ancient city of Thebes, Luxor is said to preserve a third of <br> the world’s ancient monuments between the pillars of its majestic temples. Dubbed <br>the world’s greatest open-air museum, the capital of Upper Egypt recently celebrated <br> the grand reopening of the 2.7km (1.7 mile) Avenue of the Sphinxes, an ancient <br>thoroughfare connecting Karnak Temple, home of the famed Temple of Amun-Ra, and  <br> the impressively preserved Luxor Temple
            
            <br> <br> A sunrise hot air balloon ride will give you a captivating bird's-eye view of this city of <br>ancient wonders. Once you're back on the ground, head to Hatshepsut Temple and  <br>Medinet Habu – two massive ancient architectural wonders that feature prominently <br> on travelers' Instagram feeds – and cross the river to the Valley of the Kings, the royal <br> burial site of Tutankhamun, Seti I and Ramses II.

         <h1> 4. Black and White Deserts</h1>
        <blockquote>The appeal of Egypt’s Black and White Deserts is quite literally black and white. <br> These monochrome landscapes are like something out of a sci-fi movie, but the <br> surreal scenery is a product of natural geology – the White Desert’s uniquely shaped <br> limestone rock formations give the illusion of a snowscape, while the Black Desert <br> features small black volcanic stones scattered over bright orange-colored sand.
        <br> <br> A visit to either of these desert areas is perfect for a stargazing camping trip – it's the <br> ultimate escape for anyone who’s had their fill of temples and big city traffic. The <br> White Desert and Black Desert lie just south of the Bahariya Oasis, in Egypt’s Western <br> Desert, which is accessible by bus from Cairo.
        <br> <br>Local tip: While you’re out there, make sure you visit Crystal Mountain, a natural rock <br> arch surrounded by glittering walls of quartz crystals, and Djara Cave, one of the <br> country's most impressive, stalactite-filled caves. You’ll need to crouch down to enter <br> the cave, but once inside, the ceiling looks like it’s coated in giant icicles.
