       <p> India’s astonishing variety of sights has to be seen to be believed. Travelers have devoted lifetimes to exploring the famous places and forgotten corners of this incredible country, driven onwards by the certainty that there’s always more to see.
        <br> <br> Mughal palaces, towering Hindu temples, mountain monasteries, lost kingdoms, cultured cities, and genteel hill stations in the foothills of the Himalayas all jostle for attention in a country that is proudly shaking off the legacy of colonialism and repositioning itself as a global superpower. With such incredible diversity on offer, there’s just one question – where do you start?
    
    
    <br><br>Well, our advice is to not take on too much during a single visit. Pick an area – the tropical south perhaps, or the northern plains, or the mountain valleys of the Himalayas – and give yourself time to pause and soak up the atmosphere as you work through your must-see list.

   <h1>1. Agra, Uttar Pradesh</h1>
   <blockquote>At the top of everyone’s bucket list, the Taj Mahal is as glorious as people imagine it would be – a magnificent monument to lost love, executed in pearl-white marble. Views of the world’s most beautiful building framed by a Mughal archway or floating above the misty Yamuna River will be one of the defining moments of any trip to India.

    But there’s more to the former Mughal capital than the Taj. Add on a couple of days so you can visit the architecturally stunning tomb of Emperor Akbar, his rose-red sandstone former capital at Fatehpur Sikri and sprawling Agra Fort, one of India’s most epic fortifications. Thronged by millions of visitors, Agra is not always relaxing, but it’s eternally fascinating.

    <h1>2. Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh</h1>
    <br> <br> There are few places as beguiling and bewitching as the sacred Hindu city of Varanasi. Millennia-old death rituals play out daily at the cremation ghats that line the bank of the sacred River Ganges, while the maze-like alleyways of the nearby old town reveal dizzying surprises at every turn. We defy anyone to visit without experiencing some internal soul-searching about their place in the universe.
    <br> <br>Be ready for some challenges. The hard-edged realities of life and death and the inequalities that continue to cause hardship for many in India are obvious on the streets of the world’s oldest living city. But there are also moments of gentleness – rise at dawn and wander the ghats (riverside steps) and you’ll see Varanasi at its most spiritual, with its attention focused on the sacred river, before the tourist bustle changes the mood.
    <br> <br>Planning tip: The best way to appreciate Varanasi’s famous ghats is from a rowboat. Boatmen offer their services from first light at boat stations along the west bank of the Ganges, providing views of a riverfront that has changed only superficially in seven centuries.

<h1>4. Ladakh</h1>
 <br> <br>In the far northwest of India, sheltered from the monsoon by the rain shadow of the Himalayas, the former Buddhist kingdom of Ladakh is culturally and geographically closer to western Tibet than anywhere in India. In this high-altitude moonscape, towering Tibetan monasteries melt into a landscape of barren rock and wind-sculpted hoodoos (don’t miss fabulous Hemis and Thiksey on the road linking Ladakh to Himachal Pradesh). 
<br> <br> Most visitors start in the atmospheric capital, Leh, before roaming to neighboring valleys for homestay treks and trips to view turquoise salt lakes and colorful masked dances at ancient monasteries. Ladakh wasn't touched by China’s Cultural Revolution, so this is perhaps the closest independent travelers can come to experiencing the original culture of Tibet.
<br> <br>Planning tip: Getting to Ladakh is half the fun. Flights run to Leh even in the depths of winter, but the most enjoyable way in is overland, by road from either Srinagar in Kashmir or Manali in Himachal Pradesh. Buses and shared 4WDs run as long as the passes are open from June to the end of September, or you can tackle the route on a rented Enfield motorcycle.

 <h1>5. Kolkata, West Bengal </h1> 
 <br> <br> The capital of colonial British India until 1911, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) is India’s third-biggest metropolis and the country's intellectual and artistic capital. Spend a few days exploring the energetic bazaars, cultured museums and British-era landmarks, and you’ll soon fall in love with Kolkata’s irrepressible energy.
 <br> <br>Planning tip: Try to time your visit to coincide with the festival of Durga Puja in September or October, when vividly colorful effigies of the goddess are displayed in pandals (ceremonial tents) all over the city.
